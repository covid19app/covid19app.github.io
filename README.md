# covid19app - We fight together!

Mobile app(s) helping us fight the covid19 virus. Build by humans. Build for humans.


## Assumptions

1. We don't want to get be all isolated for a year and half (or more) until we have vaccine.

2. We don't want 100,000,000 people or more to die either.

3. We want to drive the #covid19 out of existence by mass testing, self quarantine, large scale quarantine, spread tracking, and of course by great healthcare!

4. We act now! Governments fund the tests. We don't have to bother with details like insurance. Maybe a month later we can send some report to some insurance or whatever. Not important right now.

5. We build this together. We use it together.

6. The data collected are for fighting this disease only (plus public research for infectious diseases). Data are accessed only by public code (everybody can review). Only aggregate data are published. The usage can be stratched in order to drive the virus out with local heath care and authorities. But we are not building surveillance, nor advertising, nor any other data reselling or repurposing.
